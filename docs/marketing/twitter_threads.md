Introducing StockAnalyzer AI -- an open-source multi-agent investment analysis engine built with Python.

3 AI agents. 12+ technical indicators. ML predictions. Backtesting. Portfolio optimization. All in one framework.

The core idea: instead of one model deciding, three specialized AI agents analyze stocks from different angles.

- Technical Analyst (35% weight)
- Fundamental Analyst (35% weight)
- Sentiment Analyst (30% weight)

They vote. A coordinator makes the final call.

The Technical Analyst Agent covers 12+ indicators:

MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, KDJ, OBV, ATR, DMI (+DI/-DI/ADX), CCI, Williams %R, PSY, and multiple moving averages.

All computed with pandas vectorized operations. Fast and clean.

Machine learning predictions powered by scikit-learn:

- Random Forest with feature importance analysis
- MLP Neural Network (64x32 hidden layers)
- 18-dimensional feature engineering
- Full metrics: MSE, MAE, R-squared

Train once, predict anytime.

Multi-source data support with automatic routing:

- Yahoo Finance (global stocks, ETFs)
- East Money / akshare (Chinese A-shares)
- Binance (crypto: BTC, ETH, SOL...)

Just pass the ticker. The system figures out the right data source.

Built-in backtesting engine:

- Buy-and-hold, SMA crossover, RSI strategies
- Performance metrics: total return, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, win rate
- Full equity curve and trade history

Test your ideas before risking real capital.

Portfolio optimization using Markowitz mean-variance model:

- Maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio
- Minimum variance portfolio
- Target return optimization
- Pure numpy implementation (no cvxpy needed)

Allocate smarter, not harder.

## Thread 2: Technical Deep Dive

**Tweet 1/8**
How does StockAnalyzer AI's multi-agent system work? A technical deep dive.

The secret sauce: weighted voting with confidence scoring. Not simple majority vote.

Each agent returns an AgentSignal (Pydantic model):

- signal_type: buy / sell / hold
- confidence: 0-100
- reasoning: text explanation
- target_price & stop_loss: optional

The coordinator multiplies confidence x weight, then normalizes.

Example: Technical Agent says BUY (80% confidence, 35% weight) = 0.28 contribution
Fundamental Agent says HOLD (50% confidence, 35% weight) = 0.175
Sentiment Agent says BUY (70% confidence, 30% weight) = 0.21

BUY wins with highest weighted score.
